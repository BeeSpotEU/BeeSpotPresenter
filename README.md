# BeeSpotPresenter
Interactive tool to support a facilitator to use Beespot with a group of beekeepers. 

The aim is:
- to enable the facilitator to apply his/her knowledge in understanding forage for honeybees and assist in decision-making
- to enable to beekeepers to learn about the amount and quality of forage available in relation their decision how many beehives a specific location can realistically support.

General description of the flow:
- Presenter opens a session
- Participants plot apiaries and beehives on the map. A discussion is facilitated on the output (locations and range where honeybees forage)
- Participants score what they think the forage availability is per apiary. This is discussed
- The facilitator explains how the food index map is generated
- A discussion is facilitated in which the results of the food index map are compared to the estimates by the participants
- Changes can be made to the map e.g. adding or removing apiaries and hives to 1. compare the effects 2. see the impact on the balance between food provision and consumption in a specific location
